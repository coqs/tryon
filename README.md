# What is this?
this is a simple uncompleted TryOn app with the Gemini NanoBanana model, </br> the backend code is clean, so feel free to check it out. </br>
# How to use this?
Simply run the frontend (Must have nodeJS installed) by: </br>
```cd website``` </br> Then ```npm install``` </br> And lastly ```npm start``` </br>
As for the backend its almost the same: </br>
```cd server``` </br> Then ```npm install``` </br> And lastly ```node main.js``` </br>
# Where and why was it not completed?
As for where it wasnt completed, its pretty simple, you just have to send back the images in the tryon folder as BASE64 to the frontend after creating the imags, and tada! it works. </br>
# Then if it is that easy? why did you not do it?
Because I am lazy, AND most importantly, I kept receiving rate limits and gemini wouldnt want to actually edit my images and kept giving me an infinite rate limit, but when i tried it in the AI studio with the 
build feature, it worked suprisingly well, with no rate limiting problems, so bare with me, but I'm pretty sure you can fix it and complete it yourself, it's easy!
# What did i learn?
1. You can read and write images with BASE64
2. To make your code clean (backend)
